# CS300_DSA-AnalysisAndDesign


  • What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

This course featured a fictional university seeking code to help them store a list of courses that the student can acess. They
required reading a csv file of courses, validating each course entry, storing the courses in a data structure, and the ability to
print a list of courses in alphanumeric order and print the number, name, and prerequisites of any individual course.
  
  
  • How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Understanding data structures is key to being able to choose the most effective method of storing and accessing information. The
first step was to create pseudocode for each data structure and analyze its runtime and memory. Considering the analysis of insert,
remove, and search functions as well as the biggest benefits and drawbacks of each structure helped choose the most appropriate
solution.


  • How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Reviewing the module resources proved to be helpful in overcoming issues during the course. Working to understand the algorithms and
data structures presented was the most effective method for myself. Occasionally, outside resources like stack overflow were also
helpful.


  • How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Data structures and their respective algorithms provide useful tools in designing software. Certain solutions will be much faster
to develop knowing how to choose the most effective structure(s) and how to build them. Knowing how to analyze algorithm runtime and
memory will also help to decide which structures are best for different situations.


  • How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project has shown me how important planning is for developing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs. Writing pseudocode
for the different data structures let me easily discern the differences between them and the biggest benefits and drawbacks. Pseudocode
also helps to write clearer, more readable code. Readable code is more easily understood, which makes it easier to update and maintain.
